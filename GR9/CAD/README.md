# Gutter_Rat 9mm Variant

A short disclaimer on the STEP file.

This is a full assembly of all parts per current STL files. Take note of the following:

- No motors are currently mounted until we decide on a preferred option. Not that they make much difference, this will follow soon.

- The EVA printhead in the Assembly is only for visual representation and not to be used for generating STLs. It is *NOT* the current version available on the EVA website. Please do not use it other than to give you an idea on mounting and orientation

- The pulleys are not added to the various Ilder and Gantry brackets, again because they are a variable part. They are in the STEP file but hidden, so you can show them and play around with your own configuration if you so wish, other wise follow the assembly guide or ask on Discord. 

- There is a Canopy mount in the STEP file, design to hold the stock canopy in place. It is a WIP component and only tested on a single printer. Call it a Beta if you wish, it needs to be refined slightly. You are welcome to use and test it and feedback would be appreciated.


Otherwise, Enjoy!
