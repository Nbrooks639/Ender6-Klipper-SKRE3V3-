# Gutter_Rat 6mm Variant
This version of the Gutter Rat modification is the least tested.

This variation was designed with the VZBot hotend in mind with a MGN9 X rail but has since been changed back to MGN12 as per normal EVA, but has no other improvements over the 9mm (GR9)version. You will need to run a custom EVA faceplate as well. This mod is designed around 6mm belts with toothed GT2 pulleys and new steppers for X/Y, plus a new control board. This mod will require a new X 2020 extrusion or a destructive change to the stock X 2020 shortening.
