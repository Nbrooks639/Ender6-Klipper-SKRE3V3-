# !!! This version is untested and very very much a Beta - Use at your own risk !!

# Gutter_Rat 6mm Variant
This version of the Gutter Rat modification is the least tested.

This variation was designed with the VZBot hotend in mind with a MGN9 X rail but has since been changed back to MGN12 as per normal EVA, but has no other improvements over the 9mm (GR9)version. You will need to run a custom EVA faceplate as well. This mod is designed around 6mm belts with toothed GT2 pulleys and new steppers for X/Y, plus a new control board. This mod will require a new X 2020 extrusion or a destructive change to the stock X 2020 shortening.

# THIS IS A WIP USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

# Gutter_Rat
Gantry mod for the ender 6


Currently there are two options available - GR6 and GR9. 

It is recommended to look at GR9 as your first option as it is the simpliest upgrade path from a stock Ender 6. GR6 is only for those that wish to run a 6mm belt setup to possibly use the VZBot style of EVA tool heads. Definitely for those more experienced in modifying or customising printers.

The GR9 version is designed to be built with as much of the stock system as possible. Belts, Pulleys, Spacers, Motherboard and Steppers can all be reused or upgraded if you wish. This flexibilty makes this a cheap upgrade to gain access to the brilliant EVA tool head system.
